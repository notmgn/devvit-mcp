See the [quickstart](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/next/quickstart) to get up and running. :::\n## Register products\nRegister products in the src/products.json file in your local app. To add products to your app, run the following command:\n```bash\ndevvit products add\n```\nRegistered products are updated every time an app is uploaded, including when you use [Devvit playtest](../playtest).\nEach product in the products field has the following attributes:",

Each sku must be unique for each product in your app. |\n| displayName | The official name of the product that is displayed in purchase confirmation screens. The name must be fewer than 50 characters, including spaces. |\n| description | A text string that describes the product and is displayed in purchase confirmation screens. The description must be fewer than 150 characters, including spaces. |\n| price | An predefined integer that sets the product price in Reddit gold. See details below. |\n| image.icon | (optional) The path to the icon that represents your product in your assets folder. |\n| metadata | (optional) An optional object that contains additional attributes you want to use to group and filter products. Keys and values must be alphanumeric (a - Z, 0 - 9, and - ) and contain 30 characters or less. You can add up to 10 metadata keys.

While your app is under development, you can use sandbox payments to [simulate purchases](#simulate-purchases). :::\n## Design guidelines\nYou’ll need to clearly identify paid products or services. Here are some best practices to follow:\n-   Use a short name, description, and image for each product.\n-   Don’t overwhelm users with too many items.\n-   Try to keep purchases in a consistent location or use a consistent visual pattern.\n-   Only use the gold icon to indicate purchases for Reddit gold.\n### Product image\nProduct images need to meet the following requirements:\n-   Minimum size: 256x256\n-   Supported file type: .png\nIf you don’t provide an image, the default Reddit product image is used.\n![default image](../assets/default_product_image.png)\n**Example**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://developers.reddit.com/schema/products.json\",\n  \"products\": [\n    {\n      \"sku\": \"god_mode\",\n      \"displayName\": \"God mode\",\n      \"description\": \"God mode gives you superpowers (in theory)\",\n      \"price\": 25,\n      \"images\": {\n        \"icon\": \"products/extra_life_icon.png\"\n      },\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"category\": \"powerup\"\n      },\n      \"accountingType\": \"CONSUMABLE\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n### Purchase buttons (required)\n#### Blocks\nThe `ProductButton` is a Devvit blocks component designed to render a product with a purchase button. It can be customized to match your app's look and feel.\n**Usage:**\n```tsx\n<ProductButton\n  showIcon\n  product={product}\n  onPress={(p) => payments.purchase(p.sku)}\n  appearance=\"tile\"\n/>\n```\n##### ProductButtonProps",

    "pageContent": "<path>Add payments, Complete the payment flow</path>\n## Complete the payment flow\nUse `addPaymentHandler` to specify the function that is called during the order flow. This customizes how your app fulfills product orders and provides the ability for you to reject an order.\nErrors thrown within the payment handler automatically reject the order. To provide a custom error message to the frontend of your application, you can return {success: false, reason: } with a reason for the order rejection.\nThis example shows how to issue an \"extra life\" to a user when they purchase the \"extra\\_life\" product.\n```ts\nimport { type Context } from '@devvit/public-api';\nimport { addPaymentHandler } from '@devvit/payments';\nimport { Devvit, useState } from '@devvit/public-api';\n\nDevvit.configure({\n  redis: true,\n  redditAPI: true,\n});\n\nconst GOD_MODE_SKU = 'god_mode';\n\naddPaymentHandler({\n  fulfillOrder: async (order, ctx) => {\n    if (!order.products.some(({ sku }) => sku === GOD_MODE_SKU)) {\n      throw new Error('Unable to fulfill order: sku not found');\n    }\n    if (order.status !== 'PAID') {\n      throw new Error('Becoming a god has a cost (in Reddit Gold)');\n    }\n\n    const redisKey = godModeRedisKey(ctx.postId, ctx.userId);\n    await ctx.redis.set(redisKey, 'true');\n  },\n});\n```",

    "pageContent": "<path>Add payments, Implement payments, Initiate orders</path>\n## Implement payments\nThe frontend and backend of your app coordinate order processing.\n![Order workflow diagram](../assets/payments_order_flow_diagram.png)\nTo launch the payment flow, create a hook with `usePayments()` followed by `hook.purchase()` to initiate the purchase from the frontend.\nThis triggers a native payment flow on all platforms (web, iOS, Android) that works with the Reddit backend to process the order. The `fulfillOrder()` hook calls your app during this process.\nYour app can acknowledge or reject the order. For example, for goods with limited quantities, your app may reject an order once the product is sold out.\n### Get your product details\nUse the `useProducts` hook or `getProducts` function to fetch details about products.\n```tsx\nimport { useProducts } from '@devvit/payments';\n\nexport function ProductsList(context: Devvit.Context): JSX.Element {\n  // Only query for products with the metadata \"category\" of value \"powerup\".\n  // The metadata field can be empty - if it is, useProducts will not filter on metadata.\n  const { products } = useProducts(context, {\n    metadata: {\n      category: 'powerup',\n    },\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <vstack>\n      {products.map((product) => (\n        <hstack>\n          <text>{product.name}</text>\n          <text>{product.price}</text>\n        </hstack>\n      ))}\n    </vstack>\n  );\n}\n```\nYou can also fetch all products using custom-defined metadata or by an array of skus. Only one is required; if you provide both then they will be AND’d.\n```tsx\nimport { getProducts } from '@devvit/payments';\nconst products = await getProducts({,\n});\n```\n### Initiate orders\nProvide the product sku to trigger a purchase. This automatically populates the most recently-approved product metadata for that product id.\n**Example**",
