You can do this using `devvit update app`.\nFirst, move into the top-level directory of your app\n```bash\n\nmy-simpler-project  # <- you should be here\n├── devvit.yaml\n├── package.json\n├── src\n│   └── main.ts\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── yarn.lock\n```\nNext, run:\n```bash\ndevvit update app\n```\nFinally, you can check the version of Devvit your app is using by looking in the top-level `package.json` file.\n```bash\n\nmy-simpler-project\n├── devvit.yaml\n├── package.json      # <- open this file\n├── src\n│   └── main.ts\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── yarn.lock\n```\nYou should see the devvit version under `devDependencies`:\n```bash\n{\n  \"name\": \"mrt-0-8-remind-me\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"license\": \"BSD-3-Clause\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"actors/my-actor\"\n  ],\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@devvit/tsconfig\": \"0.8.0\",     #<- should be the new version of devvit\n    \"typescript\": \"4.9.3\"\n  },\n}\n```",
