# Quickstart

:::note
This quickstart is _really_ quick. For step-by-step instructions, see the [**building an app guide**](dev_guide).
:::

Here's the tl;dr for building on the Developer Platform. Apps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Before
you get started, you'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.2.0+)
- a [test subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001766991-How-to-create-a-subreddit) that you moderate with
  less than 200 members
- a code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

Run the following commands to install the Devvit CLI, and then create, upload, and
preview your app. You can also follow along with the video (the tutorial starts at 1:35).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
```bash
npm install -g devvit
devvit login
devvit new --template experience-post
cd my-project
devvit upload
devvit playtest <my-subreddit>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn global add devvit
devvit login
devvit new --template experience-post
cd my-project
devvit upload
devvit playtest <my-subreddit>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" default>
```bash
pnpm install -g devvit
devvit login
devvit new --template experience-post
cd my-project
devvit upload
devvit playtest <my-subreddit>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Visit your subreddit and interact with your app. As you make and save code modifications, playtest will automatically build and deploy the app to your subreddit. Simply refresh the page to view the latest changes.

While the playtest is active, you will be streaming logs from the app. This is useful for debugging and gaining insights into how your app is running.

To stop the playtest, press `Ctrl + c`.

:::note
Reddit collects usage metrics when you use the Devvit CLI. For more information, see
[Redditâ€™s Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) and the
[Reddit Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy). You can opt out at any time by
using the `devvit metrics off` command.
