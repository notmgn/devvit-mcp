Environment setup\nMake sure you have the following software installed:\n-   Node.js v22.2.0 or higher\n-   Git v2.28.0 or higher\nYou'll also need an editor for viewing and editing code (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).\n**Option 1: Use node version manager (nvm)**\nInstall or update [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to use as a handy command-line tool for managing multiple Node.js versions on your system. This will allow you to switch between different versions easily. If you to use a different node version manager, check out these [suggestions from npmjs.org](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).\nFor macOS or Linux:\n-   Run the following command line in your terminal to install nvm.",

Both NPM and us here at Reddit highly encourage you to use nvm if possible. If that's not possible, here are some tips on how to [fix these permissions issues](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For Windows users specifically, please use a node version manager. :::",

Install Devvit\nTo download and install the Devvit CLI, run one of the following commands:\n## 3. Log in\nLog in to devvit using the Reddit account that has been allowlisted for the Developer Platform.\n```bash\ndevvit login\n```\nYou’ll be prompted to open an authorization page in your browser to allow the Devvit CLI to connect with your Reddit account. Click **Allow** to complete the login process.\n## 4. Make a project\nPick a project name that is six or more characters, all lowercase, using kebab-case. Your project name must start with a letter and can include the numbers 0 - 9. Use the following command to make your project:\n```bash\n$ devvit new <my-project>\n```\n## 5.

This creates a private version of your app that only you can see.\nFrom your project directory, run:\n```tsx\n$ devvit upload\n```\nYou’ll be prompted to do three things:\n-   Pick a name for your app (app names must be unique, between 3-16 characters, all lowercase, can't start with numerals, and include only a-z, 0-9 or '-'.).\n-   Indicate if your app is Not Safe For Work (NSFW).\n-   Copy the CAPTCHA link into a browser window and verify that you’re human.",

You can install your app on a subreddit you moderate that has less than 200 subscribers.\nFrom your project directory, run:\n```tsx\n$ devvit playtest <test-subreddit-name>\n```\nGo to your subreddit and select the three-dot menu next to the **Mod Tools** button. Click on the **Add my post** to open your app in your feed (you might need to refresh the page).\nPlaytest automatically builds and deploys your app every time you save your code, so you can edit and save your code to see the results in realtime. Refresh the page to view the latest changes. Check out the developer tools section for more [playtest features](playtest.md).\nTo end the playtest, press Ctrl + c.\n## 9. Publish\nWhen you're ready to [publish your app](./publishing), you can submit your app for review via the CLI. Learn more about app publishing and the review process [here](./publishing).",
