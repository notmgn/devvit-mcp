For example, if you run `devvit new my-first-app`, the user account ID will be `my-first-app-zzz`. The three-letter suffix makes creation easy by ensuring your app has a unique name.\n:::note\nWhen you’re testing in Developer Studio, the app will act from the developer's user account, not the generated app user account.\n:::\n## Permissions\nYour app account has the same permissions that are granted to your app.\nCurrently, when an app is installed, it will have Moderation Everything permissions, but soon apps will only be granted permissions they need on install.\n## What the mods see\nOnce a mod installs your app, the app’s user account will appear in the mod list. When the app is executed, the action comes from the app’s user account. App execution may not work if the app account is removed as a moderator.",
