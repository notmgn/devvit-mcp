This guide will help you create engaging community games that thrive in Reddit's ecosystem with lessons from some of the games we've seen so far.\n## What are community games?\nCommunity games are asynchronous multiplayer experiences built specifically for Reddit's platform. They leverage Reddit's unique social dynamics and content mechanics to create engaging, bite-sized gaming experiences that scale from single players to thousands.\n## Why build a community game?\n-   _Played by millions_ - Successful apps will be distributed to millions of users in their home feed\n-   _Hosted services_ - We provide hosting, storage (redis), and robust backend capabilities (realtime, scheduler, trigger) with every app\n-   _Build once, play everywhere_ - if you build your apps once they will run on web, android, and iOS\n-   _Monetization opportunities_ - We have reddit developer funds and payments to reward successful apps with a handful of new monetization opportunities coming soon.",

Keep it bite-sized\n-   Focus on quick, discrete gameplay loops\n-   Reduce \"time to fun\" - players should be having fun within seconds\n-   Small scope = faster development and easier maintenance\n-   Example: [r/ChessQuiz](https://reddit.com/r/chessquiz) offers daily chess puzzles rather than full matches\n### 2. Design for the feed\n-   Create an eye-catching first screen that stands out\n-   Include a clear, immediate call to action\n-   Remember: You're competing with cat videos and memes\n-   Example: [r/Pixelary](https://reddit.com/r/pixelary%5D) shows the drawing canvas right in the feed\n### 3. Build content flywheels\nReddit posts naturally decay after a few days. Your game needs a strategy to stay relevant:\n**Option A: Scheduled content**\n-   Daily/weekly challenges\n-   Automated post creation\n-   Regular tournaments or events\n-   Example: [r/Sections](https://reddit.com/r/sections) posts a new puzzle every day\n**Option B: Player-generated content**\n-   Players create content through gameplay\n-   Each play creates new posts/comments\n-   Moderation systems for quality control\n-   Example: [r/CaptionContest](https://reddit.com/r/captioncontest) turns each submission into new content\n### 4. Embrace asynchronous play\nBenefits:\n-   Players can participate anytime\n-   Lower commitment (one move vs. entire game)\n-   Larger player pool across time zones\n-   Better scalability\n### 5. Scale from one to many\nYour game should be fun at any player count:\n-   Single-player baseline experience\n-   Scales smoothly as more players join\n-   Uses leaderboards to create competition\n-   Example: [r/DarkDungeonGame](https://reddit.com/r/darkdungeongame) works solo but gets better with more players solving together",
