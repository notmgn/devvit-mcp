This will allow you to switch between different versions easily. If you to use a different node version manager, check out these [suggestions from npmjs.org](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).\nFor macOS or Linux:\n-   Run the following command line in your terminal to install nvm.\n```bash\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.6/install.sh | bash\n```",

Both NPM and us here at Reddit highly encourage you to use nvm if possible. If that's not possible, here are some tips on how to [fix these permissions issues](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For Windows users specifically, please use a node version manager. :::",
