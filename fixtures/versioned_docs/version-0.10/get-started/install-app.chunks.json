Click on the app info card to get to the _App Details Page_, and click \"Install\".\n![app details page on the developer portal](../assets/app-details.png)\nThis will give you a list of subreddits that will allow you to add the app. Generally, you can only add an app to subreddits that you moderate.\nSelect a subreddit to install the app.\n![subreddit selector modal](../assets/app-details-install-modal.png)\n:::note If the **Install** button is not active, you are not the moderator of an eligible subreddit. Try creating a new test subreddit with fewer than 200 members. :::",
