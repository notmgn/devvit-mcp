To update your subreddit app installation:\n-   Go to [My Communities](https://developers.reddit.com/my/communities) from the profile dropdown in the Developer Portal.\n-   Click the community you want to view.\n-   When a new version of an app is available for a given subreddit, you will see a blue **Update** button next to the app tile. Click the button and follow the prompts to upgrade each community.\n![app update](../assets/app-update.png)",
