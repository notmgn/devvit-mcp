For step-by-step instructions, see the [**building an app guide**](dev_guide). :::\nHere's the tl;dr for building on the Developer Platform. Apps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Before you get started, you'll need:\n-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.2.0+)\n-   a [test subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001766991-How-to-create-a-subreddit) that you moderate with less than 200 members\n-   a code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))\nRun the following commands to install the Devvit CLI, and then create, upload, and preview your app. You can also follow along with the video (the tutorial starts at 1:35).\nVisit your subreddit and interact with your app. As you make and save code modifications, playtest will automatically build and deploy the app to your subreddit. Simply refresh the page to view the latest changes.",

For more information, see [Redditâ€™s Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) and the [Reddit Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy). You can opt out at any time by using the `devvit metrics off` command. :::\n## Next steps\nNow you know how to create and deploy apps! Next up, try the following:\n-   Check out the [showcase](/docs/showcase/apps.mdx) to see what others have created.\n-   Learn how to [publish](dev_guide/#9-publish) your app and make it public in the Apps directory.\n-   Follow the [Remind Me](/docs/showcase/tutorials/remind_me.md) tutorial.",
