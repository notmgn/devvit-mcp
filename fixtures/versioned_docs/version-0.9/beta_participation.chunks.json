The sub is for longer-form discussions, feature requests, and a place to share your ideas and work.\n-   [Beta Discord](https://discord.gg/R7yu2wh9Qz): Join our server to get live (but ephemeral) chat support, participate in office hours, and connect with other devs. Message [u/pl00h](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=pl00h) or [r/devvit modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Devvit) to get dev role permissions.\n## Wonky Beta stuff\nThere are some temporary “rough edges” on the platform right now. We know these may be annoying - we are working on fixes and want to get feedback on the developer experience as quickly as possible. A few limitations:\n-   You will only be able to install your app on “test” subreddits on your own for now, i.e.\n    -   subreddits you moderate that have < 10 members\n    -   If you would like to publish an app and/or add your app to subreddit that does not meet these criteria, please send us a note via [r/devvit modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Devvit) or message [u/pl00h](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=pl00h).\n-   You need to manually update your app on every subreddit on every new version\n    -   We do not yet auto-upgrade installed apps\n-   We don’t yet have analytics available (number of users/clicks/etc)\n-   Apps will run with the permissions of the installer\n    -   Be careful if you have everything permissions to moderate multiple subreddits\n    -   Make sure that anyone installing your app on their sub understands what it does",
