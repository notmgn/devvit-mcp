Don’t worry, this is a private version that only you can see. You’ll need to [publish](./publish.md) your app to make it publicly available.\nNavigate to project directory and run the command:\n```bash\n$ devvit upload\n```\n-   At the prompt, give your app a name.\n    \n    App names must be unique and between 3-16 characters in length, all lowercase, can't start with numerals, and include only a-z, 0-9 or '-'.\n    \n-   Indicate if your app is Not Safe For Work (NSFW). The default is \"no\", so you can hit enter for this step.\nYou should see something like this:\n```bash\n> Uploading new version \"1.0.0\" to Reddit...... Success!\n```\nWhen you upload a new app, an [app account](./app-accounts.md) is automatically created just for your app.\n## Editing your app details\nTo edit your app name and description, select “Edit app details” from your app page.",
