This will not remove the code from the directory, and it will not remove the app from subreddits that have installed previous versions. Once an app is published and installed, that version will continue to exist until a moderator explicitly removes it.\n**Hide using the directory UI**  \nGo to the [Developer Portal](https://developers.reddit.com/my/apps) and find your app. From the \"App Details\" page, scroll to \"Developer Settings\" and toggle the \"Available\" option off. Note that you will not see this option for apps that have only been uploaded but not published",
