Only you will be able to see your app in the directory, and it’s available for you to use in small subreddits with fewer than 200 subscribers for testing purposes.\nTo use your app in larger subreddits, you’ll need to publish your app. To do this from the CLI, run:\n```\ndevvit publish\n```\nYour app is automatically submitted to the Devvit team for review and approval. Published apps are either public or unlisted:\n-   **Unlisted** means that the app is only visible to you in the directory, and you can install your app on larger subreddits that you moderate.\n-   **Public** means that your app is visible to all users in the Apps directory and can be installed by mods and admins across Reddit.\n:::note By default, your app is published as unlisted.\nTo publish your app as public, use `devvit publish --public`. :::\n## Publishing requirements",

This will expedite the review process.\n### Requirements for public apps\nPublic apps are discoverable on our apps directory for anyone on Reddit. These apps should be fully functional, tested, and have detailed app descriptions that non-technical users can understand. Prior to publishing make sure to:\n-   Add an app description file to the root of your project directory with:\n    -   An app overview\n    -   Instructions on how to use the app\n    -   Changelogs for new versions\n-   Test your app across viewport sizes and user states\n-   Ensure app contents can be moderated\n-   Ensure app complies with our [Developer Terms](https://redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) and [guidelines](guidelines.md)\n### Requirements for unlisted apps\n-   Add an app description file to the root of your project directory with an app overview\n-   Ensure app contents can be moderated\n-   Ensure app complies with our [Developer Terms](https://redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) and [guidelines](guidelines.md)",
