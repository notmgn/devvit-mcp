Only you will be able to see your app in the directory, and it’s available for you to use in small subreddits with fewer than 200 subscribers for testing purposes.\nTo use your app in larger subreddits, you’ll need to publish your app. To do this from the CLI, run:\n```\ndevvit publish\n```\nYour app is automatically submitted to the Devvit team for review and approval. From the CLI, you’ll be prompted to select how you want your app to appear in the Apps directory:\n-   **Unlisted** means that the app is only visible to you in the directory, and you can install your app on larger subreddits that you moderate.\n-   **Public** means that your app is visible to all users in the Apps directory and can be installed by mods and admins across Reddit.\nDon’t worry, you can change your app visibility at any time.\n## App review\nThe Developer Platform team will review your code, read through your app README.md file, and potentially test your app. The review process typically takes one week, and you’ll be notified of your app status, which could be:",
