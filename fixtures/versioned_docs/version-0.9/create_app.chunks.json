Once you’ve installed Devvit and registered as a Reddit developer, you’ll be ready to create an app.\n## Update your CLI\nFirst, make sure you are running the latest version of the `devvit` CLI. Run:\n```bash\n\nnpm install -g devvit\n```\n:::note\nIf you are running into errors, check out our quickstart for complete instructions on how to set up your development environment.\n:::\n## Make your app\nMaking an app is easy. You can create your own app from scratch or use an [app template](templates.md) to start with complete, functioning code examples.\nTo create a new app, navigate to your selected app folder and run the create command.\n```\n$ devvit new <app-name>\n```\n:::note\nProject names must be six or more characters, all lowercase, can't start with numerals and include only a-z, 0-9 or '-'. We recommend \"kebob-case\" names.\n:::\nTo create an app based on a template, use the -t flag to create a new project. The following example creates an app based on the Remind Me template.",

Templates are built into the app creation flow, and you can use the `-t` flag when creating a new project:\n```bash\ndevvit new -t <template name> <app name>\n```\n**Available templates**\n| Template | Description |\n|---|---|\n| hello-world | Illustrates the different places and configurations you can use on your custom Menu actions. Each simply prints a toast message to the screen. |\n| remind-me | Remind a user of a post or comment at a later time via a private message. It uses the Scheduler plugin to trigger an event at a later time and the Reddit API plugin to send a user a private message. |\n| three-strikes | A moderation tool to give a “bad” user strikes and inform mods when a user gets three strikes. This uses the Key Value Store plugin to store state on a per user/subreddit basis. |\n| empty | The default, boilerplate project template. Calling devvit new will use this template. |",
