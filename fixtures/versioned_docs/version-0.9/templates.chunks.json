Templates are built into the app creation flow, and you can use the `-t` flag when creating a new project:\n```bash\ndevvit new -t <template name> <app name>\n```\n### Available templates\n| Template | Description |\n|---|---|\n| hello-world | Illustrates the different places and configurations you can use on your custom Menu actions. Each simply prints a toast message to the screen. |\n| remind-me | Remind a user of a post or comment at a later time via a private message. It uses the Scheduler plugin to trigger an event at a later time and the Reddit API plugin to send a user a private message. |\n| three-strikes | A moderation tool to give a “bad” user strikes and inform mods when a user gets three strikes. This uses the Key Value Store plugin to store state on a per user/subreddit basis. |\n| empty | The default, boilerplate project template. Calling devvit new will use this template. |\n### Try it now\nYou'll be prompted to select a template during the new project creation flow.\n```bash\ndevvit new -t remind-me my-remind-me\n```\nIf you would like to see some example apps, please reach out to our team [via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FDevvit) to request access to the private Devvit repository.",
