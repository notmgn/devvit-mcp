Here are a few procedures you might need.\n## Adding an app to your subreddit\nTo add an app to your subreddit, find it on developers.reddit.com/apps. Click into the app details screen, and click the \"Install\" button.\n![Post](./assets/install-app-button.png)\nThis will give you a list of subreddits that will allow you to add the app. Generally, you can only add an app to subreddits that you moderate. Select a subreddit to install the app.\n![Post](./assets/communities-install-list.png)\n## Removing an app from your subreddit\n**Portal**  \nUninstallation is not yet available from the portal. Please uninstall from the CLI.\n**CLI**  \nYou can find a list of installations by running `$ devvit list installs`. To uninstall an app, you can then run `$ devvit uninstall [app-name] --subreddit [subreddit-name]`.\n```\n$ devvit list installs\nloading...... done\n\n App Name          Installed Subreddits\n ───────────────── ────────────────────\n test-app-one    r/testsub1 (v0.0.1)\n\n test-app-two    r/testsub2 (v0.0.3)\n\n$ devvit uninstall test-app-one --subreddit r/testsub1\n```",

All templates produce functioning code that can be published immediately. See the current list of project templates here.\n## Uploading and publishing an app\n```\n$ devvit upload\n```\nMove into your app directory and type `devvit upload`. Note: you will be asked to select a “Version Bump” when uploading or publishing. Learn more about versioning.  \nUploading your app will create a private version of your app that you can see on developers.reddit.com and install into subreddits you moderate for testing purposes. Use this for debugging purposes before publishing. You can use devvit upload after your initial version has been published if you want to test new versions before making them available to other moderators.",

This is because it is important to everyone that subreddits don't have functionality disappear suddenly, so once published and installed, that version will continue to exist until a moderator explicitly removes the functionality.\n**Hide from the store UI**  \nYou can do this from developers.reddit.com by finding your app, clicking through to the app details page, scrolling down to the \"Developer Settings\" and toggling the \"Available\" option.",
