This will not remove the code from the directory, and it will not remove the app from subreddits that have installed previous versions. Once an app is published and installed, that version will continue to exist until a moderator explicitly removes it.\n**Hide using the directory UI**  \nGo to [developers.reddit.com](https://developers.reddit.com) and find your app. From the \"App Details\" page, scroll to the \"Developer Settings\" and toggle the \"Available\" option off. Note that you will not see this option for apps that have only been uploaded, but not published\n## Manage your communities\nTo view the subreddits you moderate, select “My communities” from the profile dropdown menu. This will list app installations across all communities where you have moderator permissions.\n![mod view](./assets/mod_community_settings.png)\nClick the subreddit name to install or remove apps from your community.",
