Permissions fall into one of three categories.\n| Category | Description | Capabilities involved |\n|---|---|---|\n| UI | Permissions your app needs for the UI elements it uses. | Menu actions, custom posts, or asset use all require UI permissions. |\n| User data handling | Permissions your app needs for the way it manages user data. | The specific permissions your app requires will depend on the capabilities you’ve used: app settings, key value store, HTTP fetch, media, Redis, Reddit API, scheduler, and triggers. |\n| Moderator permissions (required) | Permission your app needs to create a mod account with everything permissions on the installing subreddit. | This permission is required for every app. |\nHere’s an example of the permissions displayed on the app detail page in the Developer Portal.",
