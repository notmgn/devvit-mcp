All apps automatically start in the payments sandbox.\n## Start a playtest\nTo test your app:\n-   Run `devvit upload` to upload your app to the Apps directory.\n-   Run `devvit playtest` .\nOnce you start a playtest session, a new pre-release version of your app is automatically created and installed on your test subreddit. The pre-release version has a fourth decimal place, so if your current app is 0.0.1, the first pre-release version will be 0.0.1.1.\nThe pre-release version is updated and uploaded to your test subreddit every time you save your app code. Youâ€™ll need to refresh your subreddit to see the updated app. This may take a couple of seconds, so be patient.\n## Simulate purchases\nIn your test subreddit, you can make simulated purchases to test your app. No gold deducted in this state.\n![Sample payment simulation](../assets/payment_simulation.png)\nTo end your playtest, press CTRL + C in the terminal session where you started it.",
