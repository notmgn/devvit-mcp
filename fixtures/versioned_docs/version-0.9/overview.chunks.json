Bring enhancements to the communities you love, run subreddits more effectively, and develop new ways for millions of users to connect.\n## Build with Devvit\nDevvit is a modern approach to an extensible Reddit. Whether you want to create event-based bots, games, widgets, galleries, hack the UI (hello, 1-click mod actions!), Reddit has got something for you. It's still early days, so we do currently have some [limitations](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/limits).\n## Test your work\nThe [Developer Studio](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/dev_studio) lets you do real-time debugging of your app on your local machine. Get your app running on production data and use your web browser’s developer tools to set breakpoints and inspect execution of your app in real-time.\n## Manage your apps\nThe [Community App Directory](https://developers.reddit.com/) is Reddit’s third-party App library. This is where you can manage and install your apps. Eventually, the directory will be the place to list your app so other redditors can install it.",
