These are temporary limitations, and they will be modified as we gain a better understanding of how developers will use this platform.\n## App execution limitations\n-   App Execution Overall Time Limit - 1 second\n    -   Developer Platform has a maximum execution time for your application of 1 second. This applies to the total time the code of your application is executing. If your application calls a method on a plugin or another App, then the running time will pause until your application code is executing. If your application exceeds this time limit, it will be terminated and no state saved.\n-   App Continuous Execution Time Limit - 1 second\n    -   Each time your application code runs, it must complete or make an external method call within 1 second. When your code runs again, the 1s time limit restarts. However, your entire application must complete execution within the overall time limit mentioned above. If your application exceeds either time limit, it will be terminated.",

    "pageContent": "<path>Limitations, Resource limitations</path>\nExecution Time Limit Example:\nLet’s say you have an app. Your app is invoked and runs some code that takes 220 milliseconds. Then it calls a method on the Reddit API Plugin to get some listings. The time limit for your script execution will stop at this point. When the Reddit API Plugin method completes, your app will start executing again. It runs some code that takes 450 milliseconds before calling another method on the Reddit API Plugin. At this point, your total application execution time is at 670 ms (220 + 450). Remember, the overall limit is 1 second, so everything is still okay. Once the Reddit API Plugin method returns, your app now has only 330 ms to run (1000 - 670). Let’s say it is doing something tough and hits the limit. At this point, the runtime will terminate your app and return a timeout error message to the invoker of your app.\n## Resource limitations\n-   App Method Argument Size Maximum - 1 MB\n    -   Invoking methods on an App is an async operation that passes through our runtime, so there is a limit of 1 MB for all the arguments passed to that method.\n-   App Memory Space Maximum - 256 MB\n    -   When your App is running, it has access to a total of 256 MB during execution.",
