You can now install apps from the command line and the Portal again.\n## Devvit 0.9.1: More event triggers and updated docs\n**Release date: April 19, 2023**\nIn this release, we've:\n-   added two new supported [event triggers](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/event_triggers) (OnAppInstall and OnAppUpgrade)\n-   updated the docs to include more details on creating custom [menu actions](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/menu_actions)\n## Devvit 0.9.0: HTTP Fetch\n**Release date: April 12, 2023**\nYour Devvit app can now make network requests to access allow-listed external domains using HTTP Fetch.

Our latest release fixes this issue with the introduction of [app accounts](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/app_accounts). These accounts will behave as bots, installers, and show up in mod logs when your app takes programmatic user-actions.\n_Additional Enhancements_\n-   **API Client updates** We are working on taking your feedback into account for expanding our Reddit API client. This release we have included the widgets API!\n-   **Type Checking in Studio** When launching Devvit Studio, you'll see immediate Typescript type errors in the build logs while developing your app. Additionally, we'll ensure your apps are fully typesafe before allowing uploads.",

[Upgrading Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/update-devvit/) will fix this issue.\n    \n-   **CLI output corrected for app updates.**  \n    We have corrected the CLI output when [updates to apps are made](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/app_update_details/).\n    \n-   **Studio updates**  \n    We’ve made some fixes and minor style upgrades to our local environment.

For example, we use this new capability in our Three Strikes mod tutorial:\n```js\n{\n   name: 'Remove All Strikes from Author',\n   description: `Reset the author's strike count to zero`,\n   context: [Context.POST, Context.COMMENT], // multiple contexts\n   userContext: UserContext.MODERATOR,\n   handler: clearStrikes,\n }\n```\n_Breaking Change_  \n**event.context has new properties**  \n`event.context` is no longer an object containing the `subredditId` or `userId`. `event.context` now contains contexts like `context.POST`.
