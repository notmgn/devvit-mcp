When you configure your products, you’ll set the price of your product in gold. The gold you receive for your products accumulates in your app account. The payout rate for gold is $0.01 per Reddit gold spent in your app.\n:::note Payouts are calculated at the end of each calendar month, and you should receive your payout in your Stripe account within 30 days. There may be an additional 5 - 7 day delay for non-US developers. :::\n## What products can I sell?\nYou can build products in your app for things like in-game items or exclusive features for tools or bots.\n![Sample payment app screen](../assets/payments_example.png)\nAll products must be approved by the Developer Platform team.

    "pageContent": "<path>Payments, Add custom handlers to complete the payment flow</path>\n## Add custom handlers to complete the payment flow\nYou must specify a function that is called during the order flow using the `addPaymentHandler`. This will to customize how your app will fulfill product orders and provide the ability for the developer to reject an order. (refunds are in progress!).\nAny error thrown within the payment handler will automatically reject the order. If you would like to provide a custom error message to the frontend of your application, you can return `{success: false, reason: <string>}` with a reason for order rejection.\nFor example, imagine a scenario where you would want to issue an \"extra life\" to a user when they purchase the \"extra\\_life\" product.\n```ts\nimport { type Context } from '@devvit/public-api';\nimport { addPaymentHandler, type Order } from '@devvit/payments';\n\nconst MAX_LIVES = 3;\nconst EXTRA_LIVES_SKU = 'extra_lives';\n\naddPaymentHandler({\n  fulfillOrder: async (order: Order, ctx: Context) => {\n    if (!order.products.some(({ sku }) => sku === EXTRA_LIVES_SKU)) {\n      // this error will be visible to your logs but not users; the order will be rejected\n      throw new Error('Unable to fulfill order: sku not found');\n    }\n\n    // redis key for storing number of lives user has left\n    const livesKey = `${ctx.userId}:lives`;\n\n    // get the current life count\n    const curLives = await ctx.redis.get(livesKey);\n\n    // reject the order if the user already has more than or equal MAX_LIVES\n    if (curLives != null && Number(curLives) >= MAX_LIVES) {\n      // the reason provided here will be delivered to the `usePayments` callback function\n      // as `result.errorMessage` to optionally display to the end-user.\n      return { success: false, reason: 'Max lives exceeded' };\n    }\n\n    // fulfill the order by incrementing the lives count for the user\n    await ctx.redis.incrBy(`${ctx.userId}:lives`, 1);\n  },\n});\n```",

    "pageContent": "<path>Payments, Implement purchases of in-app goods</path>\n:::note Products are tied to app versions. This means if you create a product in version 2.0 of your app, and change it in version 2.1, the 2.0 version will still be available in subreddits that use version 2.0 of your app. :::\n## Implement purchases of in-app goods\n![Order workflow diagram](../assets/payments_order_flow.jpg)\nOrder processing happens in coordination with the frontend and backend of your application. From the frontend, you launch the payment flow by creating a hook with `usePayments()` followed by `hook.purchase()` when you want to initiate the purchase. This triggers a native payment flow on each platform (web, iOS, Android). The native workflow works with the Reddit backend to process the order, and your app is called via the `fulfillOrder()` hook during this process. This gives your app the opportunity to acknowledge or reject the order. For example, for goods that have limited quantities, your app may not fulfill an order once the product is sold out and instead reject the order.\n### Get your product details\nYou can fetch details about products by using the `useProducts` hook or `getProducts` function.\n```tsx\nimport { useProducts } from '@devvit/payments';\n\nexport function ProductsList(context: Devvit.Context): JSX.Element {\n  const { products } = useProducts(context, {\n    skus: ['extra_life', 'cosmic_sword'],\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <vstack>\n      {products.map((product) => (\n        <hstack>\n          <text>{product.name}</text>\n          <text>{product.price}</text>\n        </hstack>\n      ))}\n    </vstack>\n  );\n}\n```\nYou can also fetch all products using custom-defined metadata or by an array of skus. Only one is required; if you provide both then they will be AND’d.\n```tsx\nimport { getProducts } from '@devvit/payments';\nconst products = await getProducts({\n  skus: ['extra_life', 'cosmic_sword'],\n  metadata: {\n    category: 'powerup',\n  },\n});\n```\n### Initiate orders",

The pre-release version has a fourth decimal place, so if your current app is 0.0.1, the first pre-release version will be 0.0.1.1.\nThe pre-release version is updated and uploaded to your test subreddit every time you save your app code. You’ll need to refresh your subreddit to see the updated app. This may take a couple of seconds, so be patient.\n### Simulate purchases\nIn your test subreddit, you can make simulated purchases to test your app. No gold deducted in this state.\n![Sample payment simulation](../assets/payment_simulation.png)\nTo end your playtest, press CTRL + C in the terminal session where you started it.",
