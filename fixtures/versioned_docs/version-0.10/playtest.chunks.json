Playtest installs your app to a test subreddit and uploads a new version whenever you save changes to your app code. You can see your app changes and logs in real time using real data.\nOne caveat: your test subreddit cannot have more than 50 subscribers. Once installed, your playtest app will be visible to other users on the subreddit.\n## Start a playtest\n-   Run `devvit upload` to upload your app to the Apps directory.\n-   Open a terminal and enter this command from the root of your project.\n```bash\n$ devvit playtest <test-subreddit-name>\n```\nOnce you start a playtest session, a new pre-release version of your app is automatically created and installed on your test subreddit. The pre-release version has a fourth decimal place, so if your current app is 0.0.1, the first pre-release version will be 0.0.1.1.\nThe pre-release version is updated and uploaded to your test subreddit every time you save your app code. You’ll need to refresh your subreddit to see the updated app. This may take a couple of seconds, so be patient.",

This will show in the output of your terminal where the playtest is running. Check out [logs](./debug.md) to learn more.\n## End a playtest\nPress Ctrl + C to exit the playtest.\nExiting the playtest does not uninstall the playtest version or revert your app back to a previous version. The playtest version you just tested will remain installed on the test subreddit.\n## Revert your app\nIf you want to revert back to the latest non-playtest version of the app, run the following command from within your project directory:\n```bash\n$ devvit install <subreddit>\n```\nIf you want to revert to a different version of your pre-playtest app, you can specify which version using the `install` command. Entering app name is optional if you are running this command from within your project directory.\n```bash\n$ devvit install <subreddit> [@version]\n```",

For example, if your playtest version is 0.0.1.6, the upload command will remove the playtest version increment and change your app version to 0.0.2.\nOnce you [publish your app](./dev_guide.mdx/#9publish) to the Apps Directory, it will be available for users to install.",
