This will allow you to switch between different versions easily. If you to use a different node version manager, check out these [suggestions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) from nmpjs.org.\nFor macOS or Linux:\n-   Run the following command line in your terminal to install nvm.\n```bash\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n```\n-   Close and re-open your terminal to have nvm available.\n    \n-   Install the latest version of Node.js.\n```bash\nnvm install node\n```\nFor Windows:\n-   Download and install nvm-windows by following the instructions in the repository.\n    \n-   Restart your terminal or command prompt.\n    \n-   Install the latest version of Node.js.\n```bash\nnvm install node\n```\n#### Option 2: Use Node.js installer from nodejs.org\n-   Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) to download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n-   Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node.js).\n:::note If you install Node.js this way, you may experience permissions issues when trying to run Devvit, which is [documented on NPM's website](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Both NPM and us here at Reddit highly encourage you to use nvm if possible. If that's not possible, here are some tips on how to [fix these permissions issues](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For Windows users specifically, please use a node version manager. :::\n### Verify Node.js installation",

In this exercise, you’ll use the [hello-world template](templates.md) to create a menu app that says \"Hello World\" when clicked.\nTo create a new directory with code for the app:\n-   From the terminal, navigate to a directory where you'd like to store your code.\n-   Enter the following command to create the app\n```bash\ndevvit new --template hello-world\n```\n-   At the prompt, enter a name for your app and press the return key.\n:::info\nRemember that app names must be between 3 - 16 characters in length, all lowercase, can't start with numerals, and include only a-z, 0-9 or '-' (for example, my-hello-world).\n:::\n### Explore your app\nYou now have a full directory with your app name. There are several files and folders in this directory. You can ignore most files, but make note of `src/main.ts`. This contains the main code for your app.\n```text\nmy-simpler-project\n├── devvit.yaml\n├── package.json\n├── src\n│   └── main.ts         # <- the main code is here (ignore the rest for now)\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── yarn.lock\n```\n### Upload your app\nNext you’ll upload your app to the [Community App Directory](https://developers.reddit.com). Don’t worry, this is a private version that only you can see.\n-   Navigate to the directory you just created (in our example, `cd my-hello-world`).\n-   Run `npm install` to install relevant dependencies.\n-   Run `devvit upload`.\n-   At the prompt, confirm the creation of your app.\n-   Add a description of your app that is at least 15 characters. You can always change your description later.\n-   Indicate if your app is Not Safe For Work (NSFW). The default is \"no\", so you can hit enter for this step.\n-   Make sure that you’re in the appropriate directory. In our example, you should be in the yourredditusername-hello-world directory.",

[Contact us](help.md) to allowlist larger subreddits on a case-by-case basis.\n:::\n### Use the Community App Directory\n-   Navigate to [My apps](https://developers.reddit.com/my/apps) and find your app in the list.\n![my apps](./assets/my-apps-5.png)\n-   Click on the entry for your app to open the app details page.\n![app details](./assets/app-details-5.png)\n-   Click the **Install** button. You will see a list of subreddits you are allowed to use to install your app.\n![app install](./assets/app-install-2.png)\n:::note\nIf the **Install** button is not active, you are not the moderator of an eligible subreddit. Try creating a new test subreddit with fewer than 10 members.\n:::\n### Use the Devvit CLI\nYou can use the CLI command `devvit install <app-name> <subreddit>` to install apps. From the CLI, enter:\n```bash\ndevvit install your-app-name r/devvit_test\n```\n### View your app\nYou're ready to use the app!",
