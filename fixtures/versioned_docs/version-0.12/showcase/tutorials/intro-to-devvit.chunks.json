Run:\n```\ndevvit new\n```\n## Step 2: Name your project\nFor this tutorial, we suggest using:\n```\nHello-[username]\n```\n## Step 3: Select the template\nWhen prompted to chose a template, scroll and select:\n```\nintro-to-devvit\n```\n## Step 4: Upload and build\nRun the following commands to get your app up and running:\n```\ncd <project-name>\ndevvit upload\ndevvit playtest <subreddit-name>\n```\nEvery app you make will have a corresponding project folder on your local machine. Here you are \"changing directory\"[1](#user-content-fn-1) into the project folder so you can run app-specific devvit commands. Uploading your project from this folder converts it to a private test app on the platform, which you can view from [my apps](https://developers.reddit.com/my/apps).",

    "pageContent": "<path>Intro to Devvit, Step 7: Playtesting</path>\nThe \"playtest\" command is for testing your code - more on that soon.\n## Step 5: Open your project\nOpen your project from your IDE[2](#user-content-fn-2). It should look like this:\n```text\nmy-project\n├── assets\n├── src\n│   └── main.tsx\n│   └── weird.tsx\n│   └── guts // don't worry about this section\n├── devvit.yaml\n├── package.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── README.md\n```\nYou'll be making updates to `main.tsx` and the `assets` folder in this tutorial.\n## Step 6: Create a post\nVisit your test subreddit. From the subreddit menu, select \"Hello Devvit\" and wait for your post to load.\n![menu_item](../../assets/intro-to-devvit-sub-action.png)\n## Step 7: Playtesting\nAs you make and save code modifications, playtest will automatically build and deploy the app to your subreddit. Simply refresh the post to view the latest changes. Press Ctrl + C to exit the playtest.\n![playtest-app-building](../../assets/intro-to-devvit-playtesting.png)\nFrom here, the post will guide you through three simple code changes! You can stop there, but we encourage you to experiment and make the post your own.",

You can see [creations made by other devs here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hello_user/?f=flair_name%3A%22hello%20devvitor%22).\nMake sure your subreddit is set to public, and select \"Share with Devvit\" from the mod menu on the post:\n![menu_item](../../assets/intro-to-devvit-mod-action.png)\n## More resources\nNow you know how to create and deploy apps! Next up, try the following:\n-   Check out the [showcase](/docs/showcase/) to see what others have created.\n-   Learn how to [publish](/publishing) your app and make it public in the Apps directory.\n-   Follow the [Remind Me](/docs/showcase/tutorials/remind_me.md) tutorial.\n## Footnotes\n\n1.
