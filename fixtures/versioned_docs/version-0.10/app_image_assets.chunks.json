Images that violate the content policy will be removed. :::\n## What’s supported?\n-   File types: JPG/JPEG, PNG, or GIF\n-   Image size: 20MB for JPG/PNG; 40MB for GIF\n-   Folder size: 1GB per app version\nThe image file name does not have any constraints, but needs to reside in the “assets” folder. The file type is determined by inspecting its contents.\n## How it works\nAdd an image to your app’s `assets` folder. The image is uploaded to Reddit and accessible in your app source code when you upload your app. New projects should have an `assets` folder in the root directory. If you’re updating an existing project, you’ll need to add the `assets` folder.",

    "pageContent": "<path>Adding images, Use an image in a post</path>\nOnce the images are uploaded to Reddit, you can show the image in one of two ways:\n-   Use the Blocks UI component to embed your image in a post (to learn more about how to style images, check out our [blocks gallery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devvit/post-viewer/1545cls/custom_post_block_kit_gallery/)).\n:::note The imageWidth and imageHeight attributes are in device independent pixels (DIPs). :::\n```tsx\n<image url=\"imageName.jpg\" imageWidth={100} imageHeight={100} />\n```\n-   Use the URL string to get the image’s public URL from the code.\n```ts\ncontext.assets.getURL('imageName.jpg');\n```\n:::note The image name is case-sensitive. Additionally, you can use nested folders to organize your assets. For example, `assets/images/imageName.jpg` will be uploaded to Reddit as `images/imageName.jpg`. :::\n## Use an image in a post\n-   Locate the `assets` folder at the root of your project directory (or create one if it’s not there).\n-   Create your image and add it to the `assets` folder.\n-   Update your code to import the new asset.
