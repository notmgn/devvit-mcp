# Beta Participation

## Support

- [r/Devvit](https://reddit.com/r/devvit): This subreddit is where we share the latest release notes and updates. The sub is for longer-form discussions, feature requests, and a place to share your ideas and work.
- [Beta Discord](https://discord.gg/R7yu2wh9Qz): Join our server to get live (but ephemeral) chat support, participate in office hours, and connect with other devs. Message [u/pl00h](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=pl00h) or [r/devvit modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Devvit) to get dev role permissions.

## Wonky Beta stuff

There are some temporary “rough edges” on the platform right now. We know these may be annoying - we are working on fixes and want to get feedback on the developer experience as quickly
as possible. A few limitations:

- You will only be able to install your app on “test” subreddits on your own for now, i.e.
  - subreddits you moderate that have < 10 members
  - If you would like to publish an app and/or add your app to subreddit that does not meet these criteria, please send us a
    note via [r/devvit modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Devvit) or message [u/pl00h](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=pl00h).
- You need to manually update your app on every subreddit on every new version
  - We do not yet auto-upgrade installed apps
- We don’t yet have analytics available (number of users/clicks/etc)
- Apps will run with the permissions of the installer
  - Be careful if you have everything permissions to moderate multiple subreddits
  - Make sure that anyone installing your app on their sub understands what it does
