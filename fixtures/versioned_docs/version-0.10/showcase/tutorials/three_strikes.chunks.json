The penalties become more severe with each strike:\n**Strike 1**: Sends a private warning message the user.  \n**Strike 2**: Bans the user from the community for one day.  \n**Strike 3**: Bans the user from the community for one year.\n| Post menu | Comment menu |\n|---|---|\n|  |  |\n## Start a project\nTo create a Three Strikes app, use the default empty [template](../../get-started/create-app.md#templates) to start a new project.\n-   From the terminal, navigate to a directory where you'll store your project.\n-   Enter the following command to create a project folder on your local machine.\n```bash\ndevvit new <replace-with-your-app-name>\n```\n-   In your new project, open `main.ts` in your code editor (we recommend VS Code).\n```bash\nyour-app-name\n├── devvit.yaml\n├── package-lock.json  # If you use yarn, this will be yarn.lock\n├── package.json\n├── src\n│   └── main.ts     # <- the main code is here (ignore the rest for now)\n├── tsconfig.json\n```",

This plugin allows you to store data in your app that will be there the next time it’s run. You also need to enable access to the Reddit API.\n```typescript\nDevvit.configure({\n  redis: true,\n  redditAPI: true,\n});\n```\n## Create helper methods\n### Create an author key\nRedis lets you store data in your app (for example, the number of strikes a user has). Each uniquely identified key is paired with an associated value and is available every time the app is run.\n-   For the three strikes app, you’ll create a key for the author of the post or comment, where {author} is a Reddit username and the associated value is the user’s strike value.\n```typescript\n/**\n * Creates a Redis key for the author\n */\nfunction getKeyForAuthor(author: User) {\n  return `$\\{author.id}_strikes`;\n}\n```\n### Get the offending post or comment\n-   Add a function that will take the onPress event and retrieve the associated post or comment\n```typescript\nasync function getThing(event: MenuItemOnPressEvent, context: Devvit.Context) {\n  if (event.location === 'post') {\n    return await context.reddit.getPostById(event.targetId);\n  } else if (event.location === 'comment') {\n    return await context.reddit.getCommentById(event.targetId);\n  }\n  throw 'Cannot find a post or comment with that ID';\n}\n```\n### Get the author of the post or comment\n-   Add a function that will get the author of the post or comment\n```typescript\nasync function getAuthor(event: MenuItemOnPressEvent, context: Devvit.Context) {\n  const thing = await getThing(event, context);\n  return await context.reddit.getUserById(thing.authorId!);\n}\n```",
