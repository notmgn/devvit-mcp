# Beta participation

## Support

- [r/Devvit](https://reddit.com/r/devvit): This subreddit is where we share the latest release notes and updates. The sub is for longer-form discussions, feature requests, and a place to share your ideas and work.
- [Beta Discord](https://discord.gg/R7yu2wh9Qz): Join our server to get live (but ephemeral) chat support, participate in office hours, and connect with other devs. Message [u/pl00h](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=pl00h) to get dev role permissions.

## Administrative

### Get your app listed

You can publish your app for personal use at any time (with some caveats). To list your app on our directory, you'll need to [submit our app review form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEyE5vrqOBlojue_mkrV25RiiHv_sxe-xqtcdzCMBTWmoROA/viewform).

We do app review on Tuesdays. After review, our team will notify you and list your app for public access.

### Request a fetch domain

We have an allowlist for the HTTP Fetch plugin. If you have a domain you'd like to use, please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_Bbs37LQe3Nrgyg6UJgOHQzYnvPRWb0tQSwf3vwKSUJaV8A/viewform).

### Contacting your users

Currently, to contact the users that have installed your app, you'll need to coordinate with our team. This will change in the future, but please reach out to the Developer Platform team to communicate key updates, bugs, etc.
