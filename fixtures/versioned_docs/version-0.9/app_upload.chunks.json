You can always change your description later.\n-   Indicate if your app is Not Safe For Work (NSFW). The default is \"no\", so you can hit enter for this step.\n-   Make sure that you’re in the appropriate directory. In our example, you should be in the yourredditusername-hello-world directory.\n```text\nyourredditusername-hello-world # <- you should be here before uploading\n├── actors\n│   └── custom-actions\n│       ├── main.ts\n│       ├── node_modules\n│       ├── package.json\n│       └── tsconfig.json\n├── devvit.yaml\n├── node_modules\n```\n-   Enter `devvit upload`.\nYou should see something like this:\n```text\n\nPublishing new version \"1.0.0.0\" to Reddit......
