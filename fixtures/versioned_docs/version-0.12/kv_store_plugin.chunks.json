You’ll need to [migrate](migrate_kv_to_redis.md) your current apps to Redis. :::\nSometimes you might want to store data in your app that will be there the next time it’s run. Remember, Reddit Developer Platform apps are stateless, so you can’t just store data in memory across executions or save data to the file system.\nTo store data, use the KV store plugin in your apps. Your data will be stored in a persistent KV store database for quick retrieval. Currently, Get, Put, Delete, and List operations are supported (see API Docs below).\nData in the KV store is partitioned by each installation of your app, so you don’t need to worry about different installations overwriting data. This means that there won’t be one single source of truth for all installations of your app, so keep that in mind. Each app installation can only access the data that it has stored in the KV store.",

    "pageContent": "<path>Key value store plugin, Methods</path>\nHere’s an example:\nLet’s say you’ve created an app and it has been installed into two different subreddits, [r/cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats) and [r/dogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs). In your app code, you save a value to the KV store. Each value is implicitly saved to a different partition, one for r/cats and one for r/dogs. When your app retrieves that value from the KV store in a later execution, the app will only see the value for the subreddit it is installed in. Any data in the KV store for another installation is inaccessible (after all, [r/CatsWithDogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/catswithdogs) is a lie). This partitioning is all done for you automatically.\n## Use\nEnable the plugin in Devvit.configure.\n```ts\nDevvit.configure({\n  kvStore: true,\n  // other plugins\n});\n```\n## Limitations\n-   Max record size - 1Mb\n-   Max KV store size (per subreddit) - 100Mb\n## Methods\n-   `put` - Assigns a value to a key in the KV store\n-   `get` - Retrieves a value from the KV store at the given key\n-   `delete` - Deletes a key from the KV store if present",
