This is useful for both beginner and advanced developers to test out new ideas fast.\nEach playground provides an interactive code editor and a live preview in the browser. No setup or account is necessary. You can start with the base template or select a new template from the new template dropdown. Changes are automatically saved as you work.\n![Playground screenshot.](./assets/play/screenshot.png)\nYou can also share your work by sharing your playground’s URL. Every change you make generates a new URL. If you share your playground with another developer, any changes they make are seamlessly forked to their own playground and won’t override your code.\n## Live preview​\nCode is executed on every change and shown in the interactive preview window. Be sure to test both dark and light modes as well as the smallest and largest screen sizes to ensure your posts look great everywhere.",

This is a great way to explore the available APIs when dotting off an object.\n![Code completion for context.use.](./assets/play/code_completion.png)\n## Type-checking​\nCode is type-checked as it's written. Failures appear in the console and also on hover. It's okay to ignore type errors, but if the type-checker can understand the code, it's more likely to run as expected and other people can probably read it easier. It's like a free test, making sure the program fits together.\n![Type-checking.](./assets/play/type-check.png)\n## Build an app​\nPlaygrounds are for experimentation. When you're ready for the next step, start a new app using your playground as a template by pressing the **Export** button. You'll need to have the Devvit CLI set up. If you have any trouble with the export process, copy-and-paste your code into a new Devvit project instead.",

A playground will attempt to persist changes to your local browser but if you lose the URL, you may lose your playground program.\n-   Apps cannot be published from a playground. Use the export feature when you're ready to launch.",

For example, none of the `Devvit.Context` APIs are enabled, so `await context.reddit.getCurrentUser()` will fail.\nCalls to unsupported APIs throw a `CircuitBreakerResponse` error with a `ServerCallRequired` message. If you see this error, don't worry. Your app may run in production, and it's usually fine to comment out this code or put in placeholder values.",
