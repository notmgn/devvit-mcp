Appropriate examples of limited expression include:\n-   Emojis\n-   Predefined dictionaries (like stock ticker symbols or a safe dictionary)\nAvoid allowing free-form text input for user interactions with UGC to minimize the risk of abuse.\n### Deleting user content\nApps should adhere to the [content deletion policy](#content-deletion-policy), ensure that users have the ability to remove their own content when desired, and that the app complies with any legal requirements related to content removal.\nBeing able to safely accept UGC is a key criteria during app review.

Metadata required for contextualizing related content (for example, post or comment ID, createdAt, etc.) may be retained.\nWhen a user account is deleted, the related user ID (t2\\_\\*) must be completely removed from your hosted datastores (e.g. Redis) and any external systems. You must also delete all references to the author-identifying information (i.e. the author ID, name, profile URL, avatar image URL, user flair, etc.) from posts and comments created by that account. You may continue to keep posts and comments created by deleted accounts, provided that the posts and comments have not been explicitly deleted.",
