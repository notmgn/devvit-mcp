The penalties become more severe with each strike:\n**Strike 1**: Sends a private warning message the user.  \n**Strike 2**: Bans the user from the community for one day.  \n**Strike 3**: Bans the user from the community for one year.\n| Post menu | Comment menu |\n|---|---|\n|  |  |\n## Start a project\nTo create a Three Strikes app, use the default empty [template](templates.md) to start a new project.\n-   From the terminal, navigate to a directory where you'll store your project.\n-   Enter the following command to create a project folder on your local machine.\n```bash\ndevvit new <replace-with-your-app-name>\n```\n-   In your new project, open `main.ts` in your code editor (we recommend VS Code).\n```bash\nyour-app-name\n├── devvit.yaml\n├── package-lock.json  # If you use yarn, this will be yarn.lock\n├── package.json\n├── src\n│   └── main.ts     # <- the main code is here (ignore the rest for now)\n├── tsconfig.json\n```",

Each uniquely identified key is paired with an associated value and is available every time the app is run.\n-   For the three strikes app, you’ll create a key for the author of the post or comment, where {author} is a Reddit username and the associated value is the user’s strike value.\n```typescript\n/**\n * Creates a KVStore key for the author\n */\nfunction getKeyForAuthor(author: string): string {\n  return `u_${author}_strikes`;\n}\n```\n## Add mod menu functionality\nStrike functionality is added to the mod menu so that the moderator can remove rule-breaking content and manage users who violate the community’s guidelines.
