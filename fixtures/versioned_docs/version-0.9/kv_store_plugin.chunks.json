Remember, Reddit Developer Platform apps are stateless, so you can’t just store data in memory across executions or save data to the file system.\nTo store data, use the key value store plugin in your apps. Your data will be stored in a persistent Redis database for quick retrieval. Currently, Get, Put, Delete, and List operations are supported (see API Docs below).\nData in the key value store is partitioned by each installation of your app, so you don’t need to worry about different installations overwriting data. This means that there won’t be one single source of truth for all installations of your app, so keep that in mind. Each app installation can only access the data that it has stored in the Key Value Store.\nHere’s an example:\nLet’s say you’ve created an app and it has been installed into two different subreddits, [r/cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats) and [r/dogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs). In your app code, you save a value into the key value store. Each value is implicitly saved to a different partition, one for r/cats and one for r/dogs. When your app retrieves that value from the key value store in a later execution, the app will only see the value for the subreddit it is installed in. Any data in the key value store for another installation is inaccessible (after all, [r/CatsWithDogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/catswithdogs) is a lie). This partitioning is all done for you automatically.",
