Once you’ve installed devvit and registered as a Reddit developer, you’ll be ready to create an app.\n## Install or update your CLI\nFirst, make sure you are running the latest version of the `devvit` CLI. The `npm install -g` command will either install or update your package. Run:\n```bash\nnpm install -g @devvit/cli\n```\n:::note\nIf you are running into errors, check out our quickstart for complete instructions on how to set up your development environment.\n:::\n## Create an app\nCreating an app is easy. You can create your own app from scratch or use an [app template](templates.md) to start with complete, functioning code examples.\nTo create a new app, navigate to your selected app folder and run the create command.\n```\n$ devvit new <app-name>\n```\n:::note\nProject names must be six or more characters, all lowercase, can't start with numerals and include only a-z, 0-9 or '-'. We recommend \"kebob-case\" names.",
