This page logs the changes to each version of Devvit.\nBefore upgrading `@devvit/public-api` in your project, always update the CLI first by running `npm install -g devvit`.\n## Devvit 0.10.25: Take two: devvit publish\n**Release Date: Aug 16, 2024**\nDevvit 0.10.25 includes the devvit publish CLI commands that were missing in 0.10.24. This release also includes a small fix for when certain Redis commands were returning 0 instead of null.\n## Devvit 0.10.24: Publishing from the CLI and other fixes\n**Release Date: Aug 12, 2024**\nDevvit 0.10.24 streamlines the app review process. Now when you use `devvit publish`, your app is automatically submitted for approval. The CLI will prompt you to select how you want your app to be displayed: public or unlisted. See [publishing an app](publishing.md) for details. We also added support for Node v22.",

Right now it’s available on web, with Android and iOS support coming soon! We've also added CLI metrics that collect data and let us continually improve the developer experience.

The kit includes UI components and general backend patterns that simplify common tasks, including pagination, columns, and toasts.

This is a breaking change, which means:\n    \n    -   You’ll need to update your app and push a new version.\n    -   Every installer needs to update their app to the latest version.\n-   The `currentUser()` method can be undefined to support logged out users. This change doesn’t impact existing apps, but when you upgrade your app, you’ll need to handle both undefined and normal user object responses from this method.\n**Updates**\n-   Fixed `useInterval` loop reliability on mobile clients.\n-   Removed deprecated commands from `devvit help`.\n## Devvit 0.10.19: Dimensions\n**Release Date: April 24, 2024**\nDevvit 0.10.19 lets you build responsive custom posts that render based on the user’s device.
